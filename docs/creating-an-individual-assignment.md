# Creating an individual assignment
Now that your classroom is setup, you’re ready to create individual assignments to share with your class.

## Before you begin
If you want your assignment to have starter code, you need a repository with the starter code.

You can choose to turn this repository into a template, but that’s not required. You can learn more about templating [here](https://classroom.github.com/help/using-template-repos-for-assignments).

## Create and name your assignment
Create an individual assignment from the assignments tab and name it accordingly.




**Note:** What’s inputted as the assignment title will auto-populate the repository prefix. You can also change the prefix manually.

## Choose a repository type
Creating an assignment creates a new repository for each student to work out of.

Choose whether the assignment repository your students are working from should be public or private. If you would like unlimited free repositories, consider signing up for [an Educator discount](https://education.github.com/discount_requests/new).


## (Optional) Import starter code
You can import starter code from an existing repository to populate the assignment repository.

Search for the name of the starter code repository and select. Makes sure this repository is from the **correct user account**.





Choose a method to import the starter code. If the starter code repository was templated, choose the template repository option. If not, choose the source importer option.

Templating your repository is optional, but significantly speeds up the code import process. [Learn how to template your repositories](https://classroom.github.com/help/using-template-repos-for-assignments)


## (Optional) Set a deadline
You can set a deadline for your assignment using the calendar or by typing in the date in MM/DD/YYYY format.


## (Optional) Additional permissions
There’s two optional permissions you can manage within your assignment.

**Give students admin permissions on their repository:** Enabling this gives students admin permissions on their repository associated with the assignment. Changing this after the student has accepted the assignment will not change their permissions.

**Enable assignment invitation URL**: Allows students to accept and access the assignment with an invitation URL. Unchecking it deactivates the invitation URL even after it is sent out. This box is checked by default.



## Share and manage your assignment
You can now use the **invitation URL** to share the assignment with your students. This can be disabled at any time.

You can view your student’s status with the assignment (If they’ve accepted it, have yet to join the class, and if they’ve submitted it. ) under the **All Students** tab.




You can access your newly created assignment under the **Assignments** tab and change its settings at any time.
