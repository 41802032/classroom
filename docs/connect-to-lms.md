## Integrating with a Learning Management System

GitHub Classroom is continuously adding support for integrating with your institution's Learning Management System (LMS)!
Connecting GitHub Classroom to a Learning Management System will unlock new capabilities that will streamline and enhance
the same workflow your used to on GitHub Classroom, such as:

- Automatic roster provisioning
- Assignment creation (Planned)
- Submission syncing (Planned)

### Supported Learning Management Systems

GitHub Classroom integrates with your Learning Management via the industry-standard LTI protocol and is certified by the
Instructional Management System Global Learning Consortium, so you can be confident your information is safe and secure. Any
Learning Management System which is compliant with the LTI standard is compatible with GitHub Classroom, such as Blackboard,
Brightspace, Canvas, Moodle, and many more!
