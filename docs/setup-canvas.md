### Troubleshooting

#### "Enable Membership Service" Checkbox is not visible
If when configuring GitHub Classroom within Canvas you don’t see a checkbox stating “Allow this tool to access the IMS Names and Role Provisioning Service”, you may have to ask your institution’s IT Administrator to enable “Membership Service Configuration” for your account.

Note: You are still able to continue linking GitHub Classroom to Canvas without this capability, but you will be unable to sync your roster from Canvas to GitHub Classroom.
