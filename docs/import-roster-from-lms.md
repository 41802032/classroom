## Importing a course roster from your Learning Management System

GitHub Classroom can automatically import your course roster from your institution's learning management
system to save you time when creating a GitHub Classroom course.

### Prerequisites

If you haven't yet, [connect GitHub Classroom to you learning management system](/help/connect-to-lms) before proceeding.

Importing a course roster from your learning management system will only work if your learning management system's privacy settings allow GitHub Classroom to receive course roster information.

### Creating a new course roster

To import a new course roster from your Learning Management, select the classroom you would like to import into. Then proceed through the following steps:

   <div class="d-flex flex-justify-around">
     <img src="/images/help/lms/roster-import/import-roster.gif" class="border" style="width: 75%;">
   </div>

1. Navigate to classroom settings within GitHub Classroom

2. Select "Roster Management" from the sidebar

3. On the "Add students" page which pops up, click "Import from your Learning Management System"

4. Select how you would like to identify the imported students by:

    - **User ID**: The Student ID as stored in your institution's Learning Management System
    - **Names**: Student full names
    - **Emails**: Student emails

    _Note:_ If you do not see the kind of identifier you want, you may have to enable GitHub Classroom to receive student name and email information per your Learning Management System's privacy settings. See [troubleshooting](#troubleshooting) for more advice.
    {: class="note"}

5. That's it! You should now have your roster imported into GitHub Classroom.

    _Note:_ If you encounter any errors, check to ensure you have enabled the roster membership service from within your Learning Management System. See [troubleshooting](#troubleshooting) for more advice.

### Syncing an existing course roster

    - **Names**: Student full names
    - **Emails**: Student emails

    _Note:_ If you do not see the kind of identifier you want, you may have to enable GitHub Classroom to receive student name and email information per your Learning Management System's privacy settings. See [troubleshooting](#troubleshooting) for more advice.
    {: class="note"}

5. That's it! Your roster should now be up to date with the latest course information from your Learning Management System.
