## GitHub Classroom glossary  

Below are specific terms we use in the GitHub Classroom application and documentation.  

#### [Classroom](/help/glossary#classroom)  
GitHub Classroom uses classrooms to organize assignments, students, and teaching assistants (TAs) around a single course. Classrooms use GitHub organization accounts which are managed on github.com, not classroom.github.com.  

#### [Identifier](/help/glossary#identifier)  
Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet duis autem consecteteur sid adipiscing quid nostrud. Per caritatem, ad caritatem.  

#### [GitHub Classroom](/help/glossary#github-classroom)  
GitHub Classroom is a free, open-source tool for teachers that helps simplify the educational use of GitHub.

#### [Group assignment](/help/glossary#group-assignment)  
Within a classroom in GitHub Classroom, teachers can create either [individual assignments](/help/glossary#individual-assignment)  or group assignments.   

#### [Individual assignment](/help/glossary#individual-assignment)  
Within a classroom in GitHub Classroom, teachers can create either individual or [group assignments](/help/glossary#group-assignment). Creating an individual assignment generates a repository within your classroom's GitHub organization account that may contain [starter code](/help/glossary#classroom). It also generates an invitation URL that each student on your [roster](/help/glossary#roster) can accept to join. GitHub Classroom automatically clones the assignment repository for each student and adds your custom prefix for the students' repositories to correspond with the assignment.

#### [Roster](/help/glossary#roster)  
Rosters are used as a way to manage students in a classroom and make it easier to track assignment submissions. Rosters can be created manually by entering a list of [student identifiers](/help/glossary#identifier). Or, they can be imported automatically from a learning management system.

#### [Starter code](/help/glossary#classroom)  
Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet duis autem consecteteur sid adipiscing quid nostrud. Per caritatem, ad caritatem.
