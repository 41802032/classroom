## Generating Learning Management System Configuration Credentials on GitHub Classroom

Before integrating GitHub Classroom within your Learning Management System, we must generate the necessary credentials.
GitHub Classroom handles this entire part of the process for you.

### Generating credentials for an existing classroom
1. After logging into GitHub Classroom, select the classroom you would like to connect to a Learning Management System on the dashboard.

2. Within that classroom, Navigate to classroom settings

3. On the "Classroom Profile" page, within "Learning Management System" the section, click "Connect to a Learning Management System."

4. Select the vendor that your institution uses as its Learning Management System. If your Learning Management System is not listed,
select "Other Learning Management System".

5. Read and follow the prompts. You should eventually see a screen which looks similar to this.

  <div class="d-flex flex-justify-around">
    <img src="/images/help/lms/github-classroom-credentials.png" class="border" style="width: 75%;">
  </div>
  <br>

> Note: You may access this screen at any time by going to your Classroom Profile within settings and clicking "Connection Settings".
