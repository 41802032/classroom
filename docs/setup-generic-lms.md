## Configuring GitHub Classroom in Another Learning Management System

Even if your Learning Management System is not listed, there's a good chance it's still compatible with GitHub Classroom.
Once you’ve obtained the credentials generated by GitHub Classroom necessary to link your course to your Learning Management System, log in to your institution’s learning management system. The following steps will walk you through the high-level overview of configuring GitHub Classroom as an external tool within your learning management system.

### Prerequisites

1. An LTI-compliant (v1.0/1.1) Learning Management System
2. Your GitHub Classroom [credentials generated by GitHub Classroom](/help/generate-lms-credentials). Make sure to keep this page easily accessible during
the configuration process!

While the individual steps differ per Learning Management System, the main idea is the same across all vendors. At a high level,
you will be following this process:

1. Configure an External Tool
2. When asked to provide a "Consumer Key", provide the "Consumer Key" from the credentials generated by GitHub Classroom
3. When asked to provide a "Secret Key", provide the "Shared Secret" from the credentials generated by GitHub Classroom
4. When asked to proivde a "Launch URL" (sometimes called Tool URL or similar), provide the "Launch URL" from the credentials generated by GitHub Classroom.
5. Once you've configured the application, you should be able to launch it!

You should then be directed the following screen. Congratulations! You successfully linked GitHub Classroom to your Learning Management System.
