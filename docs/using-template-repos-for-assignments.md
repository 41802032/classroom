Importing starter code for assignments is a very useful feature and with GitHub recently shipping the template repositories, we can leverage them in Classroom to make importing starter code much easier, and faster!

### How to use template repositories for an assignment?


![Searches for repository, then selects the option of Importing starter code with template repositories](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1490434/61005360-10631080-a336-11e9-843b-ddb3e4f011ca.gif)


When you pick your template repository as a starter code repository, you will now get two options:

  * Import starter code using a template repository.
  * Import starter code using source importer.
  * After selecting either of the options, the following steps are the same as before. More information on this can be found on our [Videos page](/videos)

Note: If the picked starter code repository is not a template repository we will try to make it into one for you. If that fails, you can do it manually from the settings page of the repository on GitHub.

### What are the advantages of using template repositories?

* Importing starter code is faster, as it uses the newer and faster [template repositories API](https://developer.github.com/v3/repos/#create-repository-using-a-repository-template).
* Template repositories can be really useful if only the lastest files in the starter code repository are important and you do not want the entire commit history.

### What do you miss out on when you use template repositories?\*
As you don’t get the complete commit history, you miss out on the following features:

* All the original tags in the repositories.
* Since repositories created from templates are a clean slate, adding them as remotes on original repository and pushing updates to them is not possible.

### Recommended option for your assignment

* A stand-alone homework assignment with starter code, or with just a README, or assignment instructions is a perfect fit for using template repositories.
* If you’re planning to create an assignment for a group project or a long project with multiple phases, you can either use separate branches for each phase and use repo templates, or you can stick to the importer.
* If you plan on pushing changes to the student repos for any updates, using the existing importer might be a better option

\* the template repos API is still under a preview and might change, but we will keep this page updated if any of those changes affect your experience on classroom.
